# Growth Plan
Generated: 2026-02-09

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Skene CLI is a developer tool serving as the installation gateway for skene-growth, with impressive UX (retro TUI, easter egg game) but zero instrumentation or viral mechanics. The product has a critical chicken-and-egg problem: it's an installer without growth loops, depending entirely on the parent product's adoption. However, its position as the **first touchpoint** and its **beautiful, shareable UX** create unprecedented opportunities to build self-reinforcing growth loops that drive both products simultaneously.

## GROWTH LOOPS IDENTIFIED

### Loop 1: Developer Showcase Loop (The "Terminal Porn" Effect)
Priority: **HIGH** | Estimated Impact: 10-15x GitHub stars, 40% conversion to active users

**Current State:** Beautiful TUI exists but generates zero sharing data
**Opportunity:** Developers love sharing beautiful terminal UIs on Twitter/Reddit/HN

**Implementation:**
- Add `--screenshot` flag to capture ANSI art as shareable images (`internal/tui/components/ascii_motion_placeholder.go` already has rich visuals)
- Inject watermark: "Built with Skene CLI → github.com/skene-ai/skene-cli"
- Auto-generate on completion with prompt: "Share your setup? (s to save screenshot)"
- Store in `~/.skene/screenshots/` with metadata (timestamp, config chosen, game score)
- Add "Share on Twitter" hotkey that opens pre-composed tweet with image attached
- Track screenshot generation and shares in anonymous telemetry

**Growth Math:**
- Current: 0 user-generated content
- Target: 20% of users create screenshots → 5% share publicly
- If 1000 users → 100 screenshots → 5 Twitter posts → ~2,000 impressions each = 10,000 new eyeballs
- Expected conversion: 2-4% try the tool → 200-400 new users
- Viral coefficient: 0.2-0.4 (sustaining growth)

**Files to Modify:**
- Create `internal/services/analytics/telemetry.go` (new)
- Extend `internal/tui/views/results.go` with screenshot capability
- Add to `internal/tui/app.go` state machine for share flow

---

### Loop 2: Project Contribution Loop (Value Documentation)
Priority: **HIGH** | Estimated Impact: 3x project adoption, 25% contributor conversion

**Current State:** `internal/services/growth/engine.go` generates contribution guides that die locally
**Opportunity:** Turn every analysis into a public artifact that attracts contributors

**Implementation:**
- Modify `internal/services/growth/engine.go` to generate **public-ready growth reports**:
  - Markdown file: `GROWTH_PLAN.md` with actionable PLG recommendations
  - Include attribution: "Generated by Skene CLI - [Add to your project](link)"
  - Auto-detect git repo and offer to create PR with report
- Add flag `--public-report` that generates sanitized version (no API keys, safe for public repos)
- Create GitHub Action that comments on PRs: "🚀 Skene analyzed this project - view growth opportunities"
- Track: report generation → PR creation → PR merge → new tool adoption

**Growth Math:**
- Target: 30% of users create public reports
- If merged into 10% of analyzed repos → badge in README
- Each badge = ~50 monthly repo visitors → 2% try Skene = 1 new user/month/badge
- After 1000 analyses → 100 public repos → 100 new users/month (compounding)
- Network effect: More badges → more credibility → higher conversion

**Value Prop Enhancement:**
- Users get **instant value** (growth plan) before installing anything
- Repo owners get **free consulting** via contribution guide
- Skene becomes **associated with high-growth projects**

**Files to Modify:**
- `internal/services/growth/engine.go` - Add public report generator
- `internal/services/analyzer/analyzer.go` - Detect git metadata
- Create `internal/services/git/pr.go` for automated PR creation
- Add `--public-report` flag to `cmd/skene/main.go`

---

### Loop 3: "Setup Competition" Gamification Loop
Priority: **MEDIUM** | Estimated Impact: 35% retention boost, 2x referrals

**Current State:** Easter egg game exists but doesn't tie to product value
**Opportunity:** Competitive leaderboard drives repeated engagement and invites

**Implementation:**
- Transform space shooter into "Setup Speed Run" challenge:
  - Track time from `welcome.go` → `results.go` (full setup completion)
  - Game plays during `installing.go` - final score = setup_time_bonus + game_score
- Create **global anonymous leaderboard** (stored at `api.skene.ai/leaderboard`):
  - No PII - just: username (optional), setup time, game score, provider choice, timestamp
  - Display top 100 in results dashboard (new tab in `internal/tui/views/results.go`)
- Add social comparison: "You're faster than 73% of users! 🏆"
- Incentivize invites: "Challenge a friend - share your score"
- Track leaderboard views → game replays → friend invites

**Growth Math:**
- Gamification increases engagement: 35% replay rate
- Leaderboard competition: 15% share their scores
- Each share → 0.5 new users (lower intent but high volume)
- 1000 users → 150 shares → 75 new users → recursive loop

**Psychological Triggers:**
- **Status** - Public leaderboard
- **Achievement** - "Top 10% speedrun" badge
- **Social proof** - "15,234 developers have set up Skene"
- **FOMO** - "Your colleague just beat your score"

**Implementation Detail:**
- Modify `internal/game/shooter.go` to emit score events
- Create lightweight backend: `api.skene.ai/leaderboard` (Cloudflare Worker + KV)
- Add opt-in during welcome: "Join global leaderboard? (anonymous)"
- Store in `internal/services/analytics/leaderboard.go`

### Loop 4: "LLM Cost Optimizer" Data Loop (Unlock Premium Features)
Priority: **MEDIUM** | Estimated Impact: 60% email capture, foundation for SaaS monetization

**Current State:** Users enter API keys but get no usage insights
**Opportunity:** Provide immediate value while building user database

**Implementation:**
- Add optional email capture at `internal/tui/views/apikey.go`:
  - "Get monthly LLM cost analysis? Enter email (optional)"
  - Store in `~/.skene/profile.json` (encrypted)
- Track anonymous usage stats via LLM client (`internal/services/llm/client.go`):
  - Tokens used, cost estimate, provider, model
  - NO prompt/response content (privacy-first)
- Monthly email: "You spent $47 on GPT-4 last month. Switch to Claude Sonnet 3.5 → save 60%"
- Includes: Provider cost comparison, usage trends, optimization tips
- CTA: "Get real-time cost alerts" → upsell to managed service

**Growth Math:**
- Email capture rate: 60% (high-value developers)
- Monthly email open rate: 40% (cost-savings topic)
- Click-through to dashboard: 15%
- Conversion to premium (future): 5%
- Email list = owned channel for product launches, partner integrations

**Monetization Path:**
- Phase 1: Free cost analysis (builds trust)
- Phase 2: "Skene Cloud" - Managed LLM gateway with cost optimization ($20/mo)
- Phase 3: Team dashboards, shared configurations ($50/user/mo)

**Files to Modify:**
- `internal/services/llm/client.go` - Add usage tracking middleware
- Create `internal/services/analytics/usage.go`
- Add email opt-in to `internal/tui/views/apikey.go`
- Backend: `api.skene.ai/usage-reports` (monthly cron job)

---

### Loop 5: "IDE Integration" Distribution Loop
Priority: **LOW** (foundational for long-term) | Estimated Impact: 5-10x distribution reach

**Current State:** `internal/services/ide/communicator.go` exists but unclear implementation
**Opportunity:** Ship as VSCode/JetBrains/Cursor extension → zero-friction install

**Implementation:**
- Create VSCode extension that embeds Skene CLI:
  - Right-click project → "Analyze with Skene"
  - Terminal UI opens within VSCode terminal panel
  - One-click install from marketplace
- Add telemetry: extension installs, activation rate, project types analyzed
- Cross-promote: CLI suggests "Install VSCode extension for quick access"
- Extension suggests CLI for advanced features → bidirectional growth

**Growth Math:**
- VSCode marketplace: 45M users
- Target niche: "LLM", "AI", "growth" keywords
- Expected installs: 0.01% of search traffic = 4,500 installs/month
- Conversion to active use: 20% = 900 new users/month
- CLI → Extension upgrade: 30% = 300/month (from existing base)

**Strategic Value:**
- **10x distribution** vs. GitHub alone
- **Lower friction** - No terminal commands needed
- **Persistent presence** - Always available in workspace
- **Upsell path** - Premium features in extension

**Files to Modify:**
- Extract core logic from `cmd/skene/main.go` into `internal/core/engine.go`
- Create `extensions/vscode/` directory with extension boilerplate
- Ensure `internal/tui/app.go` can run in embedded terminal
- Add RPC protocol in `internal/services/ide/communicator.go`
